# force-open-browser
Force open our website when opening that link in InAppBrowser (Facebook App, Twitter App, etc.)

As the `index.html` example, I'm using iframe for trying to open chrome. This way help you avoid error when this device doesn't has Chrome browser.


# Example
Open the link below in Facebook App. It will force open chrome browser if your device has chrome.
